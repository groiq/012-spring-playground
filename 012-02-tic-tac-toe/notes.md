# Notes to the tic tac toe project

## Steps

set up project

create a controller class

create a html site

create an integer array

generate a table from the integer array

fill the int array with successive numbers (test, can be removed later)

add some css to the table

fill the table with hyperlinks

look up thymeleaf doc. 

Calling up the thymeleaf interactive tutorial by mistake, rather than the docs site. 
That doesn't link to the docs site, but it does link to the 5 minutes intro: 

https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/standarddialect5minutes.html

They actually have a syntax for url expressions.

Makes me think. I'd need to link to a combination of the two indices.

Can I also display the indices in the document? That would mean accessing the indices, i.e. using a for loop rather than a foreach loop.

Check on loops as soon as I've tried out basic link syntax.
try out a basic link

Okay, I've done a static link with static text. Next try a static link with dynamic text.

I'll work with the values 0,1 and 2. Rework the temp array filler so that it uses those values.

Now, display not the value of the field, but a sign dependent of the value of the field.

check conditionals in the thymeleaf tutorial

------------------------------ Now Marker -------------------------------

add a link only if the value is 0

check out loops

try a link to an url made from the indices
