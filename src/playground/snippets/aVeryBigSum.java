 * after https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/a-very-big-sum/problem
 * 
 * handling sums exceeding max range of a numerical data type.
 * Thought: Instead of using a larger data type, track how much the sum *differs* from maximum.
 * 
 * Problem: Even if I use tricks while calculating a sum, I'd have to cast type to return the result.
 * workaround: I won't calc a sum, instead I'll compare two sums.
 * Input two arrays of numbers, return a boolean - true if first sum is larger than second.
 * Ignore "both sums equal" cases for now.
 * 
 * Data type is byte, which is the smallest integer-ish data type in Java (-127-128).
